### dga identifer

Work in progress, attempt at measuring entropy to identify domain generation algorithms commonly used by malware to choose a command and control domain for some given day.  Plan is to work with the 2013 DNS census to identify normal behavior and to use a number of domain generation algorithms to build a dataset of obviously random domains.  Further sophistication would be to fight DGAs that make use of random strings of valid words from a dictionary rather than totally random strings.
